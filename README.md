* Hospitals need efficient systems to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments. Currently, many hospitals use manual registers or disconnected software, which makes it difficult to manage records, avoid scheduling conflicts, and track patient history.
* This is a Hospital Management System (HMS) web application that allows Admins, Doctors, and Patients to interact with the system based on their roles.
